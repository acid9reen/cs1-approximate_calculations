# Approximate calculations
This lab shows how to calculate the approximate value of some basic mathematical functions.

## Introduction
Sometimes having routine work, you want to bypass it. Inventing the computer
man created such a device that was able to automate
many actions, but there was a problem in the calculation of some functions
through a computer, the way they were calculated.

## Program description
The program calculates the value of the user-selected function by
approximate and standard algorithms, as well as the error (the difference between
values of the function calculated from the approximate and standard
algorithms) outputs this as a table to the console and to a file.
